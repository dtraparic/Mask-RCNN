# Mask-RCNN
This repository tries to use the Mask-RCNN provided by Pytorch, from a simple code implementation to a more complete code with fine tuning.

Ref :
The repo starts with this tutorial, very clear and simplest usage of Mask_R-CNN :https://debuggercafe.com/instance-segmentation-with-pytorch-and-mask-r-cnn/
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html even though this tutorial is difficult to follow (many hidden functions overlooked, notably about the not-so-usual arrangement of the Mask RCNN output that need overwriting torch.transforms and transforms.Compose, gpu multiprocess management), the code is obviously very complete.
